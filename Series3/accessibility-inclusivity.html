        <p>The pop-up model has the benefit of increasing accessibility to different types of actors. Due to the inherently temporary nature of a pop-up institute, its existence and activities are spread not only through traditional modes of communication, but also by word of mouth. Based on trust and proximity of information sources, this popular form of communication can heighten interest and curiosity in a pop-up institute’s activities.</p>
        <p>A pop-up model also facilitates a more inclusive approach, by bridging the gap between ordinary citizens and experts, including policy makers. In order to address the complex issues relating to the tradeoffs that we as a society are ready to make for the sake of security, the Edgelands Institute actively and deliberately brought together various perspectives and types of actors. Unlike a top-down approach, by which expert information percolates to ordinary citizens, the Edgelands Institute developed a platform for a dynamic exchange of knowledge and experience. This in turn promoted a diversity of perspectives, from experts in various disciplines, actors and stakeholders in different fields, including artistic expression, and active collaboration by the general public. This work resulted in a rich production of artwork, facilitating an exchange beyond linguistic and cultural barriers, as well as research publications by Institute fellows.</p>
