        <p>Community engagement in Houston (TX), USA in a fight against discriminatory surveillance and racism. Through social and cultural organizing in local communities, this project aims to curtail the detrimental and long-lasting effects of data gathering on minorities, and especially on the African American children in public schools. This community engagement works also at bridging the gap between generations around digital technology in order to strengthen engagement potential and improve the social contract.</p>

        <p>Glitch Lab Art Residency & Art Show. The Glitch Lab was a social practice art residency developed by the Edgelands Institute and the NOTICE Coalition, in Houston, Texas, merging art, research and community organizing. Over a 5-month period, a diverse range of participants (artists, students and educators) explored the intersections of surveillance, education and youth justice. It created a vibrant environment for experimentation and civic engagement, culminating in an art exhibition at the Friends Gallery in Houston. The work focused particularly on disproportionate digital surveillance of minorities and marginalized youth, and on the development of new tools for resistance.</p> -->
