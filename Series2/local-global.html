        <p>A pop-up model is flexible and mobile, making it easier organizationally and materially to reproduce similar structures in different locations and thus to create decentralized networks. This horizontal dynamic is reinforced even more by today’s digital technology, which facilitates networking, interaction and connection-building between local communities and the international sphere. Devoid of resource-heavy constraints proper to highly centralized and hierarchical institutions, a pop-up structure in the digital age makes it possible to focus most of the work on crucial contemporary issues. It can adapt to local needs quickly and efficiently, while putting these issues in perspective with other locations throughout the world.</p>
        <p>Focusing its work specifically on the relations between digital technology, security and the social contract, the Edgelands Institute brought together different perspectives, needs, contexts and approaches to this highly contemporary and urgent issue. Digital technology and various online communication platforms made it possible to address this global issue collectively, while never losing sight of local needs and specificities. The dynamic network created over the duration of this pop-up institute resulted in numerous collaborations, through research, art, public forums and publications, laying the groundwork for future actions.
